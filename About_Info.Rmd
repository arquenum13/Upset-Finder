## Analysis

To construct the predictor, the previous 3 seasons were analyzed (2014 - 2016), which contained over 34,000 data points. Offensive and defensive game statistics were considered; as well as, calculated adjusted efficiency statistics. Acronyms and descriptions for the statistics are found below:

The statistics for each team and their opponent are matched and the relative difference is calculated. The resulting values are passed through a Logistic, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes model. The teams' ELO rating is used to determine which team is favored heading into the game.  The higher rated team is classified as the favorite

Each model was cross validated using 10 folds and tuned on their specific hyper-parameter. The results show that the Support Vector Machine performed the best with an average ROC score of 0.85.
